And then merge it. Then push the changes. 
Every. Single. Time.

We're doing this because my team refuses to give me a database.
So we're hardcoding everything. Because this is SO much better.

To do things that a database was literally designed for. 
And write code that can easily be done with a database.
But I don't make the decisions.
